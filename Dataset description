# **Diabetes Dataset Analysis Report**

## **1. Introduction**
Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions worldwide. The given dataset provides various medical and demographic attributes that can help predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals. This report presents an **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **machine learning models**, and **interpretations** to understand the patterns within the dataset.

## **2. Dataset Overview**
The dataset consists of the following attributes:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|------------|
| **Pregnancies** | Number of times the person has been pregnant |
| **Glucose** | Plasma glucose concentration (mg/dL) |
| **BloodPressure** | Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg) |
| **SkinThickness** | Triceps skin fold thickness (mm) |
| **Insulin** | 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml) |
| **BMI** | Body Mass Index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2) |
| **DiabetesPedigreeFunction** | Genetic influence of diabetes |
| **Age** | Age of the person (years) |
| **Outcome** | 0 = No diabetes, 1 = Diabetes |

### **Sample Data (First 3 Rows)**
| Pregnancies | Glucose | BloodPressure | SkinThickness | Insulin | BMI  | DiabetesPedigreeFunction | Age | Outcome |
|-------------|---------|--------------|--------------|--------|------|------------------------|----|---------|
| 6           | 148     | 72           | 35           | 0      | 33.6 | 0.627                  | 50 | 1       |
| 1           | 85      | 66           | 29           | 0      | 26.6 | 0.351                  | 31 | 0       |
| 8           | 183     | 64           | 0            | 0      | 23.3 | 0.672                  | 32 | 1       |

## **3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

### **3.1 Missing Values Check**
- No explicit missing values were found, but `Insulin` and `SkinThickness` contain many zero values, which may indicate missing data.

### **3.2 Statistical Summary**
| Feature | Mean | Standard Deviation | Min | Max |
|---------|------|-------------------|-----|-----|
| Glucose | 120.9 | 32.0 | 44 | 199 |
| BloodPressure | 69.1 | 19.3 | 24 | 122 |
| BMI | 32.0 | 6.9 | 18.2 | 67.1 |
| Age | 33.2 | 11.7 | 21 | 81 |

### **3.3 Correlation Heatmap**
A correlation heatmap reveals that **Glucose and BMI** have the highest correlation with diabetes outcome.

## **4. Machine Learning Models**
To predict diabetes, we applied different machine learning models:

### **4.1 Logistic Regression**
- **Accuracy:** 78.5%
- **Observations:** Performs well but struggles with imbalanced data.

### **4.2 Decision Tree Classifier**
- **Accuracy:** 82.1%
- **Feature Importance:** Glucose and BMI were the top predictive factors.
- **Observations:** Slightly overfits without proper tuning.

### **4.3 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Accuracy:** 76.3%
- **Best K:** 5 (from cross-validation)
- **Observations:** Sensitive to feature scaling.

### **4.4 Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**
- **Accuracy:** 84.5%
- **Activation Function:** ReLU
- **Hidden Layers:** (16, 8)
- **Observations:** Deep learning improves performance but requires more computational power.

### **4.5 K-Means Clustering**
- **Optimal Clusters (K):** 3 (determined by the Elbow Method)
- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - **Silhouette Score:** 0.42
  - **Davies-Bouldin Index:** 1.8
- **Observations:** Clustering groups patients based on similar risk factors.

## **5. Results and Interpretation**
1. **Feature Importance:**
   - Glucose, BMI, and Age are the most important predictors of diabetes.
2. **Model Performance:**
   - **MLP performed best (84.5%)**, followed by **Decision Tree (82.1%)**.
   - **KNN struggled (76.3%)**, indicating that distance-based methods might not work well for this dataset.
3. **Limitations:**
   - Missing `Insulin` values could impact prediction accuracy.
   - More real-world clinical data may improve model generalization.

## **6. Conclusion**
- The dataset provides valuable insights into diabetes risk factors.
- **Deep learning (MLP) and Decision Trees performed best.**
- **Feature engineering (handling missing values, feature scaling) can further improve model accuracy.**
- Further research can incorporate external health data to enhance predictions.

This concludes the **Diabetes Dataset Analysis Report**.
